## Data Visualizations

### Authors' waking times and productivity

Inspired by [this graphic](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/12/16/writers-wakeup-times-literary-productivity-visualization/) which charted famous writers' wake-up times and some aspects of their literary output. The graphic looks pretty but isn't easy to actually ready and make comparisons. This revamp uses [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) to create an interactive display which is sortable by a variety of variables in the data set.

Most of the content is in `barChart.js`.
